# Installation

Move the Sketch Palettes plugin into your Plugins folder. You can get access to that folder by opening the Plugins menu, and choosing "Reveal Plugins Folder..."


# Usage

#### Saving Palettes

You can save color palettes from either the Global Colors section of the color picker or from the Document Colors section. Selecting "Save Palette..." in either menu will save those colors as a .sketchpalette file to whatever location you choose.


#### Loading Palettes

You can load colors into either the Global Colors section of the color picker or into the Document Colors section. Selecting "Load Palette..." from either menu will prompt you to open a .sketchpalette file containing the colors you want to load. This will replace whatever colors are currently in the selected section.

#### Removing Palettes

Select "Clear Palette" to remove all colors from either the Global Colors section of the color picker or from the Document Colors section.
